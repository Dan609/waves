\section*{Introduction}

Measurement of Ca waves in isolated rat heart
An intracellular accumulation of \ce{Ca^2+} caused by a failure of the ATP-dependent mechanisms known to be the key events in myocardial damage during ischemia \cite{shen1972myocardial,shen1972kinetics,nayler1981role}.
In the process of damage progression functional myocardial tissue becomes \ce{Ca^2+} -overloaded and then lost functionality with the properties of \ce{Ca^2+} waves changing progressively over time \cite{minamikawa1997situ,hama1998real}.
Now it is well acknowledged that \ce{Ca^2+} -overloaded cardiomyocytes are essential substrate for arrhythmias and contractile failure, especially in acute myocardial infarct.
\ce{Ca^2+} dynamics at the border zones between the infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium is considered to be a key element for arrhythmogenesis \cite{takamatsu2008arrhythmogenic}.
In this study, we applied the method of confocal microscopy and carried out a frequency analysis of calcium oscillations in cardiomyocytes from border zone between the necrotic and healthy myocardium.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\textcolor{red}{Capitalize trade names and give manufacturers full names and addresses (city and state).}

\subsection*{Animals}

Studies were conducted in accordance with regulations of the National Committee on Bioethics of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sechenov Institute of Physiology and Evolutionary Biochemistry.
Experiments were performed in hearts isolated from adult Wistar male rats (N = 00; body weight 200–250 g).

\subsection*{Heart staining}

Animals were anesthetized with sodium Nembutal (50 kg - 1 , i.p., 50 mg), and then the hearts were harvested/removed via thoracotomy.
The preparation was retrogradely perfused via the aortic cannula through with a Tyrode’s solution of the following composition (mM): 140 NaCl, 1.0 \(\,\mathrm{Mg}\mathrm{Cl}_2\), 4.5 \ce{KCl}, 10 glucose, 1 \ce{CaCl2} and 10 HEPES.
The pH of the solution was maintained at 7.4 by continuously bubbling with 95\% \ce{O2}/ 5\% \ce{CO2} and temperature maintained at 37 C\degree.
Effluent was drained via a catheter placed in dish so as not to touch the heart.
Myosin ATPase inhibitor, blebbistatin (10 $\mu$M, Sigma, USA) was added to the Tyrode’s solution perfusing the heart to stop heart contraction and prevent associated artifacts (Farman et al., 2008).
To prevent motion artifact in optical recordings, muscle contraction was inhibited with 20 $\mu$ M/L of (-)-blebbistatin \cite{kong2014role}.
The dyes Fluo-4-AM,Tetramethylrhodamine Methyl Ester Perchlorate, TMRM, and Di-8-ANEPPS, was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Heart perfusion was performed using a modified Langendorff system. Tyrode solution with \ce{CaCl2} (1 mM/L) was used as the perfusion medium.
A similar solution with the addition of the fluorescent dyes Fluo-4 (20 $\mu$ M/L) and Di-8-ANEPPS (20 $\mu$ M/L) was used for visualization of the \ce{Ca^2+} waves.

\subsection{Confocal microscopy}
To investigate spontaneous \ce{Ca^2+} waves in myocardium, we positioned isolated perfused heart in organ bath with thin bottom (180 $\mu$ m), left ventricle in conjunction with an oil-immersible objective lens on an inverted microscope (Leica).
This combination provide sufficient depth discrimination to focus directly onto the epicardial layers and individual cells within the intact functioning organ.

To the simultaneous detection of fluorescence of Fluo-4 and TMRM we used an argon laser with a wavelength 488 nm and a power of 80\% and a HeNe laser with a wavelength of 543 nm and a power of 80\%.
The fluorescence detection was carried out in the spectral range 493 nm -- 540 nm for Fluo-4 and 552 nm -- 792 nm for TMRM. Since the specific values of the background fluorescence depended on the density of the capillary network, the amount of connective tissue in the field of view, and other factors, the sensitivity of the PMT detector (gain) was selected individually each time, depending on the conditions of the survey, and was usually 600 to 800 units.
changes in fluorescence intensity of Fluo-4 over time (xyt mode) were measured, a resonant scanner (8000 Hz) was used, and the diameter of the confocal pinhole was set to 100\ mu m.
A fluorescent signal was registered in the first layer of cardiomyocytes adjacent to the epicardial surface of an isolated heart (Fig. 1). The fluorescent signal was measured in a whole frame or in certain regions of interest (regions of interest, ROI).
Spectral analysis of calcium oscillations was carried out using a fast Fourier transform.
Studies were carried out on the model of an isolated working rat heart perfused by the method of Langendorff.
The subepicardial layers of the myocardium were examined using an inverted Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a resonance scanner and x20, x63 lenses with oil immersion.
For visualization of cardiomyocytes, vascular network and connective tissue, perfusion of the hearts was performed with a solution with the addition of the fluorescent dye Di-8-ANEPPS.
To visualize free \ce{Ca^2+} ions, the Fluo-4 dye was used.
For dyeing mitochondria, the TMRM dye was used, the fluorescence intensity of which is proportional to the value of the mitochondrial membrane potential ( $\Delta$ $\psi$).
With the simultaneous detection of fluorescence Fluo-4 and Di-8-ANEPPS, an argon laser with a wavelength of 488 nm and a power of 80\% was used to excite the fluorescence.
Fluorescence detection was carried out using two photomultiplier tubes (PMT), 491nm - 581nm for Fluo-4 and 611nm - 792nm for Di-8-ANEPPS.
With the simultaneous detection of fluorescence Fluo-4 and TMRM, an argon laser with a wavelength of 488 nm and a power of 80\% and a HeNe laser with a wavelength of 543 nm and a power of 80\% were used to excite the fluorescence.
The fluorescence detection was carried out in the spectral range 493 nm-540 nm for Fluo-4 and 552 nm --- 792 nm for TMRM.

Calcium imaging with Fluo-4/AM was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope Leica SP5 with a 40x (NA = 1.3) oil immersion objective. Fluorescence images (excited at 488 nm).
The pinhole was set to 200 mm, resulting in , 2.5-mm optical slices. Amplifier gain and detector offset were adjusted such that neither saturation nor threshold cutoff occurred.
The membrane structure of epicardial myocytes was analyzed in situ by confocal microscopy Leica SP5 equipped with x63 (NA = 1.4) oil-immersion lens]. The epicardial images were used to define the

In ischemic myocardium, calcium waves are considered as an arrhythmogenic substrate.
The effect of hypoxia on calcium oscillations in the epicardial layer of cardiomyocytes.
\\
In the course of myocardial observations after simultaneous staining of Di-8-ANEPPS and Fluo-4 under conditions where cardiac contractions were inhibited by blebbistatin, normal myocardial regions characterized by passage of a global calcium-ejection wave corresponding to sinus rhythm and small contractions were revealed. Tissue abbreviations were determined by averaging the Di-8-ANEPPS fluorescent signal from ten arbitrarily selected ROIs of 20 $\mu$ m x 20 $\mu$ m size (Figure 5). Also, the areas of the myocardium, located in different stages of ischemic damage, were identified. For the initial stage of damage, groups of cardiomyocytes with an increased value of \ce{Ca^2+}, in which high-frequency calcium waves were observed (Fig. 6), are characteristic. Nascent on the edge of the cell or in its middle, these waves can spread to neighboring cells (Figure 7). With a slight increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, such waves are erased by each subsequent global calcium release (Figure 11, B), and with a strong increase in \ce{Ca^2+} in cardiomyocytes relative to the baseline observed in the normal myocardium, the global calcium release does not interfere with the formation of calcium waves (Fig. 11, B, D). The cardiomyocytes adjacent to the necrosis zone were characterized mainly by slow, damped calcium waves with a large amplitude (Fig. 8).

The FFT analysis of calcium oscillations showed that in the cardiomyocytes of the perineecrosis boundary zone, as the concentration of \ce{Ca^2+} increases, the amplitude of normal fluctuations in the concentration of ionized \ce{Ca^2+} first increases (Figure 11, A), then single calcium waves break the sinus rhythm (Figure 11, B) , then autonomous high-frequency calcium oscillations arise that attenuate, reaching a certain threshold, (Figure 11, Figure 13, Figure 13), after which the cardiomyocytes begin to hyper-shrink. Such calcium waves can be a source of arrhythmias and contribute to the development of contractile dysfunction in heart diseases.

Spontaneous Ca waves in cardiomyocytes is assotioated with local damage sites.
Fig. 1 A shows a comparison of \ce{Ca^2+} levels in normal (ROI1) and locally damaged (ROI11) cells along with maximum \ce{Ca^2+} level registered from totally Ca-overloaded hypercontracted cell.

Studies were made of the frequency characteristics of calcium waves arising in cardiomyocytes of the border zone. For comparison, 12 cells were selected located next to the necrosis zone (Fig. 9). In each cell, an ROI was determined in which fluorescence fluctuation values of Fluo-4 were measured. The obtained values were processed by the FFT method in the Origin program, some of the frequency characteristics of the calcium waves are shown in Fig. 10 (the data table is presented in the file Fluo-4.
When the mitochondria and free \ce{Ca^2+} ions were stained in the absence of contractile activity and sinus rhythm (inhibition by BDM) in the heart, they were detected as areas of the normal myocardium, characterized by a high $\Delta$ $\psi$ and a low value of \ce{Ca^2+} (Fig.2, a, Fig.3, ROI 4-6), and areas of the myocardium, which is in different stages of ischemic damage.
An area was identified where, in one field of view of the microscope, it was possible to take readings from cells in successive stages of approach to death. A number of characteristics of the cells were built up, with increasing signs of ischemic damage.
For the initial stage of the lesion, groups of cardiomyocytes with a reduced and a high value of \ce{Ca^2+} are characteristic (Fig. 2b, Fig. 3, ROI 2-3). In such cells, oscillations of \ce{Ca^2+} (calcium waves) were observed. At further stages of damage in the tissue, foci of necrosis appear, which are noticeable by the appearance of necrotic striation (Fig. 2, c, d). When a normal myocardium section was observed for 25 min, a continuous decrease in the fluorescence intensity of TMRM was recorded, fluorescence intensity of Fluo-4 first increased for 15 min, and only then began to decrease (Fig. 4). These data are consistent with the notion that as the decreases, the mitochondria begin to accumulate \ce{Ca^2+}.

% By how many cells were investigated in different areas? Those graphs that you give it for individual cells? If so, it is necessary to paint each cell in detail. For example: sample 1 - intensity of the calcium signal ???, location relative to the necrosis focus ???, intensity MX ??? and all that we can say (contractility, the distribution of MX ...). Please do this for each schedule.

% In addition, you need a detailed description of each schedule. What changes specifically: amplitude, frequency, etc. Also write down in detail.

For the initial stage of damage, groups of cardiomyocytes with an elevated value of \ce{Ca^2+}, in which high-frequency calcium waves were observed (Fig. 6), are characteristic. Nascent on the edge of the cell or in its middle, these waves can spread to neighboring cells (Figure 7). With a slight increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, such waves are erased by each subsequent global calcium release (Figure 11, B), and with a strong increase in \ce{Ca^2+} in cardiomyocytes relative to the baseline observed in the normal myocardium, the global calcium release does not interfere with the formation of calcium waves (Fig. 11, B, D). Undoubtedly, the prognostic significance can be the detection of the switching point from the state of the cell, in which global waves can crush pathological, contributing to the restoration of a normal rhythm, to a transition through the "point of no return" when recovery is no longer possible.
We found that cardiomyocytes located in the border zone adjacent to the necrosis zone are characterized by an increased content of Ca2 + ions, a reduced mitochondrial potential and contractile activity. Studies were made of the frequency characteristics of calcium waves arising in cardiomyocytes of the border zone. For comparison, 12 cells were selected located next to the necrosis zone (Fig. 9). In each cell, an ROI was determined in which fluorescence fluctuation values of Fluo-4 were measured. The obtained values were processed by the FFT method in the Origin program, some frequency characteristics of the calcium waves are shown in Fig. 10 (the data table is presented in the file Fluo-4 ROI 01-12.xlsx
The FFT analysis of calcium oscillations showed that in the cardiomyocytes of the perineecrosis boundary zone, as the concentration of Ca2 + increases, the amplitude of normal fluctuations in the concentration of ionized Ca2 + first increases (Figure 11, A), then single calcium waves break the sinus rhythm (Figure 11, B) ,
then autonomous high-frequency calcium oscillations arise which, attaining a certain threshold, decay (Figure 11 B, D, Figure 12, Figure 13), after which the cardiomyocytes begin to hyper-shrink. Such calcium waves can be a source of arrhythmias and contribute to the development of contractile dysfunction in heart diseases.
The cardiomyocytes adjacent to the necrosis zone were characterized mainly by slow, damped calcium waves with a large amplitude (Fig. 8).

\section*{Discussion}

\cite{bonilla2019enhancement} provide the first demonstration of local, transient \ce{Ca^2+} entry
(LoCE) events, which comprise cardiac SOCE. Although infrequent in WT myocytes, LoCEs occurred
with greater frequency and amplitude in CpVt myocytes.

As was clearly demonstrated \cite{matsuura2018intravital},
Ischemic myocardial damage manifests itself as a source of calcium waves.
We show in this paper, on a model of an isolated rat heart, what a the frequency characteristics of calcium oscillations recorded in the border zone near necrosis.
Intracellular calcium accumulation caused by weakening of ATP-dependent mechanisms due to lack of oxygen supply causes foci of high-frequency calcium oscillations that go out of control by sino-atrial thythm.

scale modeling approach that spans from single channel to whole-cell and spatial
simulations, we show that both CICR and SOICR gating modes can indeed activate RyR2 channels and modify \ce{Ca^2+} spark dynamics in a manner consistent
with experimental observations. However, detailed comparison of \ce{Ca^2+} wave
generation and CRU-to-CRU \ce{Ca^2+} wave propagation shows that CICR alone
is a sufficient, and necessary, mechanism to explain Ca2þ release in heart under
both physiological and pathological conditions
\cite{williams2017does}

We assume that such high-frequency activity may cause arrhythmias.

In the ischemic myocardium \ce{Ca^2+} waves are regarded as arrhythmogenic substrates.
To quantitatively image how \ce{Ca^2+} waves interfere with \ce{Ca^2+} transients from spontaneous sinus rhythm we used a single-photon confocal laser scanning microscopy in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts.
This technique has allowed Intravital imaging visualization of \ce{Ca^2+} waves propagation at the single-cell level in epicardial cardiomyocytes, avoiding the damage induced by isolation of cardiomyocytes.
The effects of hypoxia on oscillations in intracellular calcium concentration \ce{Ca^2+} were determined in isolated rat heart.
The aim was to investigate the frequency characteristics of calcium oscillations arising in the epicardium in response to ischemia
Spectral  analysis of myocardial analysis of calcium oscillations in rat heart using confocal microscopy was carried out.
Optical recording of calcium currents in the rat myocardium during the development of ischemic injury.
In cells located at the periphery of the lesion focus, the basal level of calcium remains within normal limits, point-like, prismatic wave sources appear that do not extend to the cell as a whole and are extinguished by a wave of normal ejection.
A wave of normal ejection is the result of the work of the pacemaker cells and is accompanied by a synchronous muscle contraction.
In cells closer to the lesion focus, the calcium concentration rises.
Microtraumas, points of damage are sources of waves.
As a result of the hyperscrubbing of ischemic cells, there are gaps between the cardiomyocytes that become the sources of individual transverse waves that cover the whole cell and are able to spread to neighboring cells.
As a result of interference of several calcium waves, wave packets arise, the amplitude of which increases as the intracellular concentration of free calcium ions increases.
An arrhythmia arises, representing a group of partially damaged and contiguous intact myocardial cells characterized by an elevated concentration of free calcium ions that have their own rhythms of calcium release and muscle contractions and are not affected by pacemaker cells.
and during the detachment of the cell the frequency increases spasmodically.
Intracellular calcium waves were intensively studied in isolated cardioiocytes by the linescan method (Gyorke, Sunil Kapur).
The results obtained revealed the large role of calcium sparks in the nucleation of these waves.

hypercontracture-indused calcium oscillations interfere with Systolic \ce{Ca^2+} alternans
SR \ce{Ca^2+} content changes during alternans \cite{diaz2004sarcoplasmic}
We assume that high-frequency calcium oscillations arise at the time of cardiomyocyte damage caused by hypercontraction.
Since in the course of hypercontraction initial damage can be localized as two adjacent sarcomeres,
Propagation of transverse calcium wave along longitudinal axis
Such anisotropic protagation of calcium waves was described in 1994 by Engel et al, and velocity of wave propagation rise with temperature.
Formation of calcium waves of different type in isolated cardiac myocytes \cite{ishida1999formation}
that this type of calcium waves initiate from stochastic \cite{izu2001evolution} subdiffusive  \cite{chen2014ryanodine} Chen et al  calcium sparks.
This propagation pattern was satisfactorily explained by Finite-element simulations of the three-dimensional cell model, conducted for different intracellular locations of triggering calcium sparks \cite{tracqui2009integrated}
we observed for 100 sec Sustained transverse calcium wave patterns in epicard of isolated heart
for some time the damaged cardiomyocyte, which has not lost its connection with neighboring cells, can be a source of high-frequency calcium waves, which are transmitted to neighboring cells through gap junctions.
Tomoyuki at al using confocal device with simultaneous recording of electrocardiograms demonstrated that \ce{Ca^2+} waves in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were completely abolished by ventricular excitation, and that under highly \ce{Ca^2+} -overloaded conditions \ce{Ca^2+} waves may occur more frequently and propagate more prevalently to the surrounding cells. Authors suggested that \ce{Ca^2+} waves play little, if any, pathophysiological role (6,7). Later, it was established that myocardial injury induces \ce{Ca^2+} waves in the heart (8,9). Baader et al proposed that spatio-temporal summation of changes in membrane potential caused by individual \ce{Ca^2+} waves may underlie the generation of triggered electrical ectopic impulses (10).
In recent years, it has become apparent that myocardial ischemia can cause ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.
Time series

Wavel coherence analysis of calcium oscillation reveal...
Wavelet transform coherence (WTC) is a method for analyzing the coherence and phase lag between two time series as a function of both time and frequency (\cite{chang2010time}).


Wavelet toolbox is a useful tool to study hyperscanning data. Many recent publications on NIRS hyperscanning use wavelet coherence to quantify the relationship between two interacting brains (e.g. Baker et al 2016, Nozawa et al 2016). You can see more information about wavelet coherence at \href{http://www.alivelearn.net/?p=1169}{site}.

In the above figure, I plot the wavelet coherence between the two signals in both time and frequency domain. Coherence is kind of correlation. 1 (red) means the two signals are highly correlated and 0 (blue) means no correlation. There are definitely something interesting between the two signals.

First, there is a red band in the period 8 region. As the sampling frequency of the signals is 10Hz, period 8 means 0.8s. This band is originated from heart beating (~1Hz) and indicates that the two people’s heart beating is highly correlated.

Second, there are some red blobs in the period 64 region. The button pressing is occurring at 6-7s frequency. These blobs indicate that the two people’s brain are correlated during button pressing.

So, with wavelet coherence analysis, you can discover something you might not discover with other methods.

In the following examples, I created two time series, x (blue) and y (red) with different properties (phase shift, frequency and amplitude) and run wtc(x,y,’mcc’,0) command. Small white noise was added to the time series.

Phenomenon
This resulted in
 during the repolarization phase,
thus further increasing APD and \ce{Ca^2+} loading. This positive-feedback loop led to EADs and
ultimately failure to repolarize. It is possible that the saturating behavior of LCC \ce{Ca^2+}-dependent activation in this model prevents sufficient LCC inhibition required for repolarization in
the presence of elevated SR \ce{Ca^2+}
The LCC model also does not incorporate “global” \ce{Ca^2+}
sensing , which would inhibit LCC openings in the presence of sustained elevated \ce{Ca^2+}.
Future work is needed to understand the contributions of these mechanisms, as they may
affect the conditions under which the model exhibits DADs during pacing.The distribution of DADs was controlled by both \ce{Ca^2+} and \ce{Ca^2+}SR. This was revealed
by the apparent change in the threshold SR \ce{Ca^2+} load for spontaneous \ce{Ca^2+} wave formation
during pacing (see Fig 3). Elevated diastolic \ce{Ca^2+} increased RyR opening rate and thus perpetuated \ce{Ca^2+} wave formation at lower SR \ce{Ca^2+} loads. It also caused more rapid loading of the
SR to induce overload. Cellular \ce{Ca^2+} loading also increased the amplitude of DADs due to the
greater number and concurrence of \ce{Ca^2+} wave nucleation sites, which is in agreement with
A significant contribution of this work is that the emergence of sudden arrhythmias can be
causally linked to stochastic molecular events. A computationally efficient method was developed to estimate the probability of extreme DADs. An important assumption of this method is
that the spontaneous \ce{Ca^2+} release events in neighboring cells are decoupled. It is known that
membrane depolarization increases the frequency of \ce{Ca^2+} waves by reducing NCX-mediated
\ce{Ca^2+} efflux and thus promoting \ce{Ca^2+} waves due to increased intracellular \ce{Ca^2+} \cite{walker2017estimating}.

According to

\iffalse
our \ce{Ca^2+} dynamics studies to date [9, 11, 25], such nonuniformity
in the \ce{Ca^2+} transients was not predominantly
observed in intact ventricles, and the observed features in
the atrial \ce{Ca^2+} dynamics would partly be related to the
structural difference, i.e., paucity of t-tubules.

In principle, individual atrial myocytes in the perfused
hearts showed spatiotemporally uniform \ce{Ca^2+} dynamics
with frequency-dependent abbreviation of \ce{Ca^2+}-transient
durations, a confirmation of the atria being a functional
syncytium (Fig. 2). However, even under apparently intact
Langendorff perfusion, individual myocytes often exhibited
spatially non-uniform \ce{Ca^2+} dynamics, e.g., cluster-like
rises of \ce{Ca^2+}, wave-like propagation of \ce{Ca^2+}, and beatto-
beat variability of durations and amplitude alternans of
\ce{Ca^2+} transients, all of which emerged on excitation instead
of uniform \ce{Ca^2+} transients (Figs. 3 and 4). \cite{jiang2014pacing}, \cite{aguirre2014intravital}

Spontaneous \ce{Ca^2+} waves during diastole are indicative of cellular Ca 21 overload \cite{macquaide2007measurement}
